# Further on the Right Path

The office of New Urban Mechanics was a brilliant first move by Mayor Menino, and it can be refreshed and expanded under the Walsh administration.

### Keep: New Urban Mechanics

The Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics was a pioneering step in civic technology; Boston was highlighted in one of the first sessions at the Code for America summit in October 2013, and is considered a leader in civic technology and engagement. It can continue to be so.

### Keep: Chris Osgood & Nigel Jacob

Chris and Nigel have demonstrated exceptional leadership and innovation, piloting state-of-the-art civic technology projects. Keeping Chris and Nigel will maintain consistency in leadership and allow the program to flourish without transitional thrashing.

Chris and Nigel are advisors to [Code for Boston][cfb], the Boston brigade of [Code for America][cfa]. They also advise the [MetroBoston DataCommon][mbdc], the regional data-sharing program implemented by the [Metropolitan Area Planning Council][mapc].

### Keep: The focus on regional data

The Office of New Urban Mechanics has implemented Citizens Connect and other programs in many municipalities in the metro area. The City of Boston should continue to set an example for the rest of the region, and develop infrastructure that is easily replicable in other cities and towns.

### Implement: Innovation Fellowship

In 2011, [Code for America Fellows] worked with New Urban Mechanics on projects such as Bostonavigator, Discover BPS, Where’s My School Bus, Building Boston, Boston Public Schools, and Boston Public Works.

__Problem:__ Code for America prioritizes fellowships based on need. Boston has well-established civic technology, so may not see a fellow for some time. However, the fellowship positioned a developer in a year-long position within New Urban Mechanics, providing consistent effort for civic technology projects and experience for a recent graduate.

__Solution:__ Implement a fellowship program to mirror the Code for America Fellowship Program, sourcing talent from Boston schools and institutions, giving many more civic-oriented developers and designers the opportunity to serve their city.

__Precedent__: The San Francisco Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation has a [dedicated fellow][fellow] similar to a Code for America fellow.

### Dream: Innovation Infrastructure

__Problem:__ New Urban Mechanics is an innovative department but appears to have minimal authority, and no head officer.

__Pathways:__

+ Consider implementing a [Civic Innovation Officer][cio], such as the one in the Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation in San Francisco.
+ Consider creating an Innovation Department, or modify New Urban Mechanics to include an Experimentation Team. This team would, like a startup, attempt to develop and implement boundary-breaking civic technology using an lean (i.e. low-cost) agile approach.
+ Consider establishing an Innovation Fund to provide for the Innovation Department’s experimentation. Adopt a fail-forward approach that expects occasionally failures but ensures introspection enough to learn from these events.




# Access for All

Civic technology should not be for the sole benefit of people like me: privileged, white, upwardly-mobile middle class, familiar with the ins and outs of government, surrounded by similar others. Civic technology at its best would be an equalizer, allowing everyone access to government and facilitating interactions between the two. Civic technology should be designed for people who need the most assistance: people with low  literacy, people with short-term memory loss, people with learning disabilities, or people in situations (such as poverty or hunger) who could not easily focus on documents with legal or technical language.

### Implement: Design for Everyone

Your opponent, John Connolly, raised a smart point during the campaign:  City Hall should run like an Apple Store. TODO expand

__Problem:__ City documents are hard to read. Many city government processes are often difficult to start and more difficult to follow through on.

__Solution:__ Hire a team of design thinkers (i.e. information designers, user experience designers) and enable them to fully rework one process in City Hall, from the design of the forms to the workflows of the employees. Have the team debrief the redesign, and build upon their learning to improve other processes.

__Precedents:__

+ [Chicago’s online permitting office][permit] lets you know where in the process you are, who last touched it, and when it was last addressed.
+ [AnywhereBallot][ab] used design thinking to design a ballot that enabled people to vote even if they had low literacy, medical conditions (including a stroke), or other problems contributing to being unable to follow a multi-page ballot.

### Implement: Write for Humans

__Problem:__ Long, small-print legal documents are hard to read for people who were well-educated and have high English proficiency. They are nearly impossible to read for people who have lower English proficiency, lower literacy, or a learning disability.

__Solution:__ 

+ Mandate that the design of future forms and documents be as cleanly-designed and easy to read as this memo.
+ Mandate that all public-facing documents be translated into English that is accessible to the many in Boston who have low literacy, mental illness, a learning disability, or any other factor that could contribute to trouble reading long, small-print, legal documents. This could look like ‘no-fear Shakespeare’ with two column documents showing the original legal on one side, and accessible language on the other.
+ Use [Write for Humans][wfh] from the [Department of Better Technology][dobtco] to inform this process.

### Dream: Baseline digital access

__Problem:__ In Cambridge, public schools often require internet access for homework. I expect the same is true of Boston. However, public housing (and assuredly much private housing in low-income areas) has little access to technology.

__Pathways:__

+ Ensure that all public housing has reliable WiFi in a public area, or ideally, across the entire housing complex. The Cambridge Housing Alliance, CCTV, and Code for Boston are presently working on a project to repair and maintain reliable wireless access for residents of Newtowne Court.
+ Provide all public school students in public housing with a low-cost computer. A [Raspberry Pi][pi] with a [case][case] and [WiFi module][wifi] is $62, and, preloaded with some [office software][libre], would provide for students’ baseline technology needs.
+ Fund publicly accessible computer areas and free training for people in low-income, low-internet access neighborhoods.

### Dream: Mandatory computer education

__Problem:__ Technology is the new literacy. In the past, basic reading and writing skills gave someone an advantage. Today, basic understanding of a computer code gives someone an advantage that literacy. Since ubiquitous technology has proven itself to not be a fad, it is time to embrace computer literacy — especially coding — as the new literacy.

__Solution:__ Mandate computer education for all middle- and high-school students. Computer education should be no more elective than basic reading and writing skills. Enable them to acquire jobs in one of the only fields that has consistently grown throughout the Great Recession, as well as to control technology for their personal and professional benefits.

__Note:__ This is not a proposal that everyone be forced or even encouraged into STEM majors. I majored in Geography and Studio Art, and learned to code in my own time. I bring my liberal arts education with me every day to my job as a web developer.




# Business & Innovation

### Implement: Open Procurement to Smaller Businesses

__Problem:__ At present, only large businesses have the resources to endure traditional government procurement processes, even when smaller businesses would have the capacity to work on government scale.

__Solution:__ 

+ Use one of the new technologies designed to ease the facilitate process, such as SmartProcure or products from the Department of Better Technology, such as Screendoor.
+ If additional assistance is desired, the  Metropolitan Area Planning Council has demonstrated success in its collective procurement program. It may be able to advise the City of Boston on improvements to the procurement process.

### Dream: Facilitate Civic Startups

__Problem:__ Civic-oriented startups could bring an agile approach to solving government problems, but few such startups presently exist.

__Solution:__

+ Incubate civic startups. Grow businesses alongside government to develop tight relationships, the way MassChallenge businesses interface with funders / venture capitalists now.
+ Partner with MassChallenge or another incubator to avoid overhead associated with incubator development.

__Precedent:__ San Francisco’s civic startup incubator

### Dream: Add Affordable Commercial Space to the Innovation District (and elsewhere in Boston)

__Problem:__ The founder of Danger!Awesome, a laser-cutting studio in Central Square, Cambridge, explained to me that the primary reason he was able to afford the space for his startup was due to a fluke in rent. Had he not stumbled upon a lucky deal, he would not  have had the opportunity to develop the business.

This is likely true of many startups in the Boston area: they don’t have a chance succeed locally due to unaffordable space. This will be especially relevant in the Innovation District, where most of the buildings are, or  soon will be, new construction.

__Solution:__ Designate affordable space within the Innovation District and elsewhere, so that experimental startups with low funding but high potential can survive in the Boston market. This space might have an expiration on affordable, similar to  affordable housing.




# More Data, More Opportunity

When Code for Boston asked the City of Cambridge to open their GIS data, they did so without knowing what we would do with it. In a couple of weeks in our spare time, we wrote an app that helps citizens get instant directions to their polling place.

More data in open, machine-friendly, standard formats means more opportunities for city employees and volunteers to make something that helps citizens and government connect and get along. It’s okay for there to be a machine interface between city and citizens. There are a lot of citizens and not a lot of government.

### Implement: Make city data “open by default”.

__Problem:__ Much of the data that is ‘public record’ is locked away, and would not be difficult to release.

__Solution:__

+ Use the Sunlight Foundation’s recommendations to inform the open data ordinance.
+ Give enforcement authority to the City of Boston’s Chief Data Officer, so that the publishing of public record datasets can be expedited.

__Precedent:__ Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville, Kentucky announced an “open by default” provision for its public record data. The recommendations on open data by the Sunlight Foundation should inform the Boston ordinance.

### Implement: Research anonymization / de-identification

__Problem:__ Despite a usually generous response to requests for open data, city and state employees naturally protect any datasets that are considered ‘private’ or ‘protected’. No well-intentioned developer is interested in identifying citizens, but much of this data — if stripped of identifying details—would be useful to developers and to city employees.

__Solution:__ Hire a consultant or internally source talent to research best practices in de-identification / anonymization of sensitive data. Ideally, research would determine a set of ways for city employees to process data to eliminate identifying information while enabling city and volunteer developers to extract insights from this data.

### Dream: Build out Boston’s data department

__Problem:__ As more data is made available, more hands will be needed to manage and update it.

__Solution:__ Add staffing to the data department to facilitate federation / transfer of data between departments.
